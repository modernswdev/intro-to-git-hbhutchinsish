## What I Learned!

- I learned how to create repositories and create markdown files!
- I learned how profile READMEs are created!
- I learned about the basic overview of GitHub.
- I learned how commits work (kind of) 🥲


## What I'm Still Confused About!

- How branches and merging work
- What exactly do pull requests do and how do I attempt one?
- About 50% of the buttons on my screen
- How is GitHub used in the workforce and how should I prepare?
